            <p>Arctic was the largest and most celebrated of the four Collins steamers that had
                operated a regular transatlantic passenger and mail carrying service since 1850. After the collision
                Arctic's captain, James Luce, first attempted to assist the stricken Vesta, which he believed was in
                imminent danger of sinking. When he discovered that his own ship had been seriously holed below the
                waterline, he decided to run her towards the nearest land, in the hopes of reaching safety. His plan
                failed; the engines stopped when the ship was still far from land. Arctic's lifeboat capacity was less
                than half of those on board; when Luce ordered these launched, a breakdown in order and discipline meant
                that most places in the boats were taken by members of the crew or the more able-bodied male passengers.
                The rest struggled to build makeshift rafts, but most were unable to leave the ship, and went down with
                it when it sank, four hours after the collision. Vesta, which initially appeared to have sustained
                mortal damage, was kept afloat by her watertight

                bulkheads,and managed to limp into harbor at St. John's, Newfoundland.

                Two of the six lifeboats that left Arctic reached the Newfoundland shore safely, and another was picked
                up by a passing steamer, which also rescued a few survivors from improvised rafts. Among these was
                Captain Luce, who had regained the surface after initially going down with the ship. The other three
                lifeboats disappeared without a trace. The rudimentary telegraph facilities of the time meant that news
                of Arctic's loss did not reach New York until two weeks after the sinking. Initial public sorrow at the
                ship's loss quickly turned to anger at the perceived cowardice of the crew. Despite press calls for a
                full investigation into the disaster, none was held, and nobody was held legally responsible for his
                actions. Demands for the introduction of further safety measures on passenger-carrying vessels were
                likewise sidestepped. Luce, who was generally exonerated from blame by the public, retired from the sea;
                some of the surviving crew chose not to return to the US. The Collins Line continued its transatlantic
                service, until further maritime losses and insolvency led to its closure in 1858.</p>
